# Getting Started

Welcome to the Markdown Documentation Viewer! This lightweight documentation system is designed to help you create and maintain beautiful documentation with minimal effort.

## What is this?

The Markdown Documentation Viewer is a simple, static documentation site that:

- Renders Markdown files into beautiful HTML
- Provides a structured table of contents from a YAML file
- Includes search functionality
- Works without any build process
- Is fully responsive for mobile and desktop

## Quick Overview

This system consists of just a few core files:

1. **index.html** - The main HTML structure
2. **styles.css** - All the styling
3. **app.js** - The application logic
4. **toc.yml** - Your documentation structure
5. **docs/** - Your Markdown documentation files

## Why Use This?

Unlike complex documentation systems that require build processes, this viewer:

✅ **Zero Build Required** - Just edit Markdown files and refresh

✅ **Lightweight** - Only uses CDN libraries, no npm packages to install

✅ **Easy to Deploy** - Works on any static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)

✅ **Simple to Customize** - Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript

✅ **Fast** - No server-side processing needed
